# OpenRTX
## Modular Open Source Radio Firmware

OpenRTX is a free and open source firmware for digitam ham radios, top-down designed
with modularity, flexibility and performance in mind.

Currently OpenRTX is being actively developed for the TYT MD-380/390 and MD-UV380/390.

This firmware is *highly experimental* and is not in a usable state right now,
however contributions and testing are welcome and accepted.

## Compilation

To build and install the firmware, first clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/n1zzo/OpenRTX
```

The following steps depend on the selected platform:

### Linux

The OpenRTX linux build depends on libSDL, on Ubuntu you can install it with:
```
sudo apt install gcc pkg-config libsdl2-dev
```

The firmware can be compiled with:

```
meson setup build_linux
meson compile -C build_linux openrtx-linux
```

If you are using a version of Meson older than v0.55.0, the above command will fail, compile with:

```
meson setup build_linux
ninja -C build_linux openrtx-linux -jN
```

Where N is the number of cores that you want to allocate to the build process.

### TYT MD-380 / TYT MD-UV380

To build the firmware you need to have a toolchain for the ARM ISA installed
on you system, you can install one using your package manager.

For example on Ubuntu you can install `arm-none-eabi-gcc`
```
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

You can then proceed in building the firmware:

```
meson setup --cross-file cross_arm.txt build_md380
meson compile -C builddir openrtx-md380
```

If you are using a version of Meson older than v0.55.0, the above command will fail, compile with:

```
meson setup --cross-file cross_arm.txt build_md380
ninja -C build_md380 openrtx-md380 -jN
```

Where N is the number of cores that you want to allocate to the build process.

If everything compiled without errors you can connect your radio via USB,
put it in recovery mode (by powering it on with the PTT and the button
above it pressed), and flash the firmware:

```
make flash
```

Now you can power cycle your radio and enjoy the new breath of freedom!
