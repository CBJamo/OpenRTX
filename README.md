# OpenRTX
## Modular Open Source Radio Firmware

OpenRTX is a free and open source firmware for digitam ham radios, top-down designed
with modularity, flexibility and performance in mind.

Currently OpenRTX is being actively developed for the TYT MD-380/390 and MD-UV380/390.

This firmware is *highly experimental* and is not in a usable state right now,
however contributions and testing are welcome and accepted.

For information on currently supported radios and features, see the [Development status](https://github.com/n1zzo/OpenRTX/wiki/Development-status) wiki page.

For hardware and software documentation visit [openrtx.org](https://openrtx.org/)

## Compile and flash

For instructions on how to compile and flash OpenRTX to your radio,
or just run OpenRTX on Linux see the [How to compile](https://github.com/n1zzo/OpenRTX/wiki/How-to-compile) wiki page.

OpenRTX was created by:

- Niccol√≤ Izzo IU2KIN <n@izzo.sh>
- Silvano Seva IU2KWO <silseva@fastwebnet.it>
- Federico Amedeo Izzo IU2NUO <federico@izzo.pro>
- Frederik Saraci IU2NRO <frederik.saraci@gmail.it>

All this was made possible by the huge reverse engineering effort of
Travis Goodspeed and all the contributors of [md380tools](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/md380tools).
A huge thank goes to Roger Clark, and his [OpenGD77](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/OpenGD77) which not only inspired this project, but as a precursor, provided a working code example for the GD77 radio family.
